#Project Idea: Predicting Hospital Readmissions

#Scope Determining if diabetes a predictor of hospital readmission

#Research Questions to Answer
#1. What factors are the strongest predictors of hospital readmission in diabetic patients?
		a. Preventative care
		b. Age, race (other demographics)
		c. Underlying medical conditions
		d. Medical history (Inpatient visits, outpatient and emergent)
		e. Income?
		f. Length of admission
		g. Lab test results (glucose levels, A1C, etc..)
	
#2. How well can we predict hospital readmission in this dataset with limited features?
What is the rate of hospital readmission for patients with diabetes compared to those without?
This question aims to establish a basic comparative metric between diabetic and non-diabetic patients in terms of their readmission rates.
What factors associated with diabetes contribute to higher hospital readmission rates?
This question delves deeper by looking at specific diabetes-related factors such as blood sugar levels, type of diabetes, diabetes management practices, and complications that may influence readmission.
How do comorbid conditions in diabetic patients affect their likelihood of readmission?
Many patients with diabetes have other conditions like hypertension, heart disease, or kidney disease. Understanding how these comorbidities interact with diabetes can provide insights into their combined impact on hospital readmission rates.
Does the duration of a patient's diabetes diagnosis correlate with their probability of hospital readmission?
This question explores whether the length of time a person has been diagnosed with diabetes affects their risk of being readmitted to the hospital.
Are there differences in readmission rates among patients with Type 1 versus Type 2 diabetes?
Comparing these two main types of diabetes could reveal important differences in readmission risks and needs for follow-up care.
What role do socioeconomic factors play in the readmission of diabetic patients?
Examining the impact of factors such as income, education, and access to healthcare could help identify whether disparities exist that affect readmission rates.
How effective are post-discharge follow-up treatments in preventing readmission of diabetic patients?
Investigating the effectiveness of different follow-up care plans, including medication management, dietary counseling, and regular monitoring, could identify best practices to reduce readmissions.
What predictive models can be developed to identify diabetic patients at high risk of readmission?
This involves using data analytics to create predictive models that help healthcare providers identify patients who are at increased risk of readmission.
